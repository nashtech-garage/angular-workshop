# Angular 20 Example Library

This directory contains 20 standalone Angular examples grouped by topic. Each example is a standalone component or service illustrating a focused concept using Angular v17+ (compatible with Angular 20).

## Structure

- `forms/` – Reactive and template-driven form patterns
- `http-client/` – HTTP requests, interceptors, and advanced options
- `signals/` – Signal primitives, computed values, effects, and stores

Import the standalone component or provide the service in your playground module to experiment with the examples.
